Sir,
	The main focus work is over the testing, project managment, designing and the flow of the interface.
	‘javaapplication1’ contains all the modules that are being integrated by me. Which were developed by the 
  respective group members (modules were: mainmenu.java and register.java).
	Test cases are being performed by myself and commit change regarding the failure of the test case.
